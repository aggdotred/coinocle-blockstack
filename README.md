# Guild

[Guild](http://www.guildblog.com) is a decentralized, server-less, blogging app powered by [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/intro). It is a blogging network where you own the content you create and can share your favorite posts with others. No longer will you be restricted to a single companyâ€™s walled gardens. Your writing will live on and travel with you.
